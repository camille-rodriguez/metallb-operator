# If RBAC is enabled in the cluster, then the operator pod for both
# metallb-controller and metallb-speaker need to be granted permission to # use the K8s API for some specific actions. 
# This step is not automated because once bug LP# is fixed, it will no
# longer be necessary to use the K8s API.
